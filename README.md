# vaccination

The task of the application is to send notifications (reminders) about upcoming vaccination dates.

The user registers his children in the application. The application prepares a vaccination plan for a child based on the Polish vaccination calendar. When the vaccination deadline is approaching, the application sends a reminder e-mail to the user. After vaccination, you must complete the data in the application.

In a similar way, the application reminds about periodic examinations of children and adolescents recommended in Poland.
